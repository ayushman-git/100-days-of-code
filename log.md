# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Async...Await module on codecademy and made weather-app responsive to bigger screen size.

**Thoughts:** I think now I've a better understanding of asynchronous programming in javascript. I now understand how promise system works and how to consume a promimse. I also worked on my weather-app and made some changes. I changed each module so that their content will appear vertically centered.
