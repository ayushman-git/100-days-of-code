# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: July 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed Async...Await module on codecademy and made weather-app responsive to bigger screen size.

**Thoughts:** I think now I've a better understanding of asynchronous programming in javascript. I now understand how promise system works and how to consume a promimse. I also worked on my weather-app and made some changes. I changed each module so that their content will appear vertically centered.

### Day 2: July 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Completed AJAX and HTTP request module on codecademy and fixed text overflow in small modules in weather-app.

**Thoughts:** Learned how to make HTTP request (GET and POST) as per pre-ECMA-2015 standard. Now able to make boiler-plate codes for GET and POST method using XHR object. Fixed a bug which makes a big text overflow in weather-app small modules.

### Day 3: July 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Used async and await with fetch and try...catch to access data. Added clouds animation on weather-app. 

**Thoughts:** Learned how to use async functions to fetch data with GET method. I found it's much simpler than XHR and normal fetch to use async and fetch together to access data. Figured out how to try and catch while using fetch. Added clouds animations on the background for cloudy day.

### Day 4: July 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Used async and await with fetch and try...catch to access data with POST method. Added rain animation on weather-app. 

**Thoughts:** Learned how to use async functions to fetch data with POST method. I used Datamuse and Rebrandly API to practice GET and POST method with this new technique. I also added a rain animation for the background on my weather-app with the help of jQuery.

### Day 5: July 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started LinkedIn HTML essential course. Added snow animation on weather-app.

**Thoughts:** Today I started LinkedIn HTML essential course. I learned new text formatting tags ```<q>``` and ```<blockquote>``` and a new list type (description list) though its not a very useful tag. Learned about semantic values of tags, for eg. ```<h1>``` tag will have more semantive value than ```<h2>```. It could be useful in accessibility of the page. So we should always follow semantic rules of html - meaning the most dominant heading should always be displayed using```<h1>```, the next most prominent heading should be usingn ```<h2>``` and so on (we can change their size and appearance with css). Learned about ```<time>``` tag and its ```datetime``` attribute. While declaring a time we should use time tag and use datetime attribute so that we can use that date in js. Learned a little about ARIA accessibility attributes - ```aria-label``` and ```aria-remove``` to add meaning or remove the semantic meaning from a tag which might have been changed because of using un-semantic methods. Also added snow effect on weather-app with SCSS.
